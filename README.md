## About Me
My name is Patryk Osowski. I'm IT Specialist after graduating from high school. I am interested in software testing and have been teaching for about one and a half years. My immediate goal is to master manual and automated testing to perfection. On this page I would like to share all my experiences gained during my personal studies and research
